                        Streetwaer was born in 1998 as a new brand of the Inditex Group.
                        
                        Streetwaer presents itself as a reference point for fashion that targets an increasingly demanding public, and in just 2 years, had consolidated its brand image in 100 shops. Today, after 18 years, the chain has more than 1000 stores in over 70 markets, with sales that represent 9% of the total revenue for the whole group.Streetwaer has a sales area of more than 455,000 square meters. The company's business encompasses the design, manufacture, distribution and sale of fashion in the stores.
                        </p>
                        <p>Streetwaer shops around the world are characterized by their strategic locations and detailed architecture. Establishments are turned into spacious, trend-setting spaces with a carefully conceived image that encompasses everything from its window displays to the clothing arrangements inside. Bershka selects the very best commercial areas in each city and positions itself in the most prominent sections of the main shopping areas. Unique buildings are often chosen, which the Bershka architectural studio then refurbishes and adapts to its brand image and philosophy.</p>
